1. __`r began_s1_demo`__ signed up for the study.
2. __`r ended_s1_demo`__ finished the demographics (`r singles` singles, `r in_relationship` in relationship).
2. __`r ended_pre`__ finished the demographic and personality questionnaires.
3. __`r at_least_one_diary_entry`__ submitted at least one diary entry (>= 20: `r at_least_20_diary_entries`, >= 50 `r at_least_50_diary_entries`). On average participants completed `r mean_diary_entries` diary entries.
4. `r finished_timespent` singles reported information on least one person mentioned during the diary (>3: `r timespent_gt3`, at least one man who wasn't biologically related: `r timespent_men`, >2men: `r timespent_3men`). 
5. __`r finished_followup`__ (`r round(100*finished_followup/ended_pre)`% of those who finished the intake survey) finished the follow-up survey. Finishers completed on average `r mean_diary_entries_finishers` diary entries.
